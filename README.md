# 100DaysOfMLCode Challenge

This it's the summary what I did to become a Data Science and Machine Learning professional

## Day 1: 23/10/2018
Today I was consuming the videos from the channel of [DotCSV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5znSnfMsDwaLlROnZ7Qbg), learning about Neural Networks and Activation Functions and seeing his YouTube Live

## Day 2: 24/10/2018
I star programming a Neural Network to clasify data into two classes. [Tutorial of DotCSV](https://github.com/corozb/100DaysOfMLCode_Challenge/blob/master/Red_Neuronal_desde_Cero.ipynb)

## Day 3: 26/10/2018
I was seeking for communities and jobs oportunities:
- Meetup: Data Science FEM and PyLadies (they admit me, what can I do THX :P), Python Medellin, Machine Learning
- Greater Copenhagen
- `Medium` articles related with reinvention stories for motivation
