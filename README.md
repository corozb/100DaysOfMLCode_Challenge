# 100DaysOfMLCode Challenge

This it's the summary what I did to become a Data Science and Machine Learning professional

## Day 1: 23/10/2018
Today I was consuming the videos from the channel of [DotCSV](https://www.youtube.com/channel/UCy5znSnfMsDwaLlROnZ7Qbg), learning about Neural Networks and Activation Functions and seeing his YouTube Live

## Day 2: 24/10/2018
I star programming a Neural Network to clasify data into two classes. [Tutorial of DotCSV](https://github.com/corozb/100DaysOfMLCode_Challenge/blob/master/Red_Neuronal_desde_Cero.ipynb)

## Day 3: 26/10/2018
I was seeking for communities and jobs oportunities:
- Meetup: Data Science FEM and PyLadies (they admit me, what can I do THX :P), Python Medellin, Machine Learning
- Greater Copenhagen
- `Medium` articles related with reinvention stories for motivation
- Slack channels
- YouTube channels (Siraj Raval, DotCSV, cctmexico, sentdex, AMP Tech)

## Day 4 : 27/10/2018
I had the chance to meeting with the girls in Data Science FEM, I knew their methodology and what can I find into the team. I showed my GitHub and what I did so I promised that the next meeting I will teach (both we learn) a simple recommendation system with data of FourSquare.

## Day 5 : 29/10/2018
I practiced the class of recommendation system that I learned in Platzi and will share with the women in Data Science FEM.

## Day 6 : 30/10/2018
Knowing seaborn library and how to graph data. Also I learnt to build 3D graphs with Matplotlib. 

## Day 7 : 01/11/2018
Practicing Pandas Libraries and how create dataframes and manipulate data

## Day 8 : 02/11/2018
Again preparing the tutorial for the women in Data Science FEM that gonna be on next day, Saturday'
